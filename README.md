# Concept
With factors like stress and anxiety becoming more prevalent than ever, many people are turning to unhealthy coping mechanisms, like emotional eating and detachment. Star Doodleis a mindfulness focused art journal that uses psychological evidence from studies to give users a better understanding of their negative emotions and practice in meditation through sublimation and artistic expression. 

# Prompts
Star Doodles randomizes prompts between either abstract/emotional prompts, such as “If you had a magic wand and could make anything you wanted appear, how would you change your life?” or prompts encouraging mindfulness/meditation, such as “draw circles along with your breath, with the start of the circle matching when you breathe in, and with the out breath starting at the half through the circle, and the end of your outbreath matching the end of the circle.” 
We will encourage that through prompts asking them to reflect on their emotional state from previous entries. 

# Journaling
Users can draw art on a canvas capable of erasing, changing brush size, and clearing. Then, they can save their drawing as a PNG file on their laptop. 
	Following this, they can describe their artwork and elaborate on their feelings in a journal entry. This is a textarea that sends its contents into a TXT file when saved.
We designed Star Doodles with convenience and utility in mind. This allows users to access and edit the contents of their journal from directly drawing on our webpage or from uploading pictures of physical art from their phone. There is also a text box under each page for traditional journaling and additional thoughts. Our emphasis on privacy also means that the user can feel safe expressing themselves.
